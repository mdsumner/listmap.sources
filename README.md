## THELIST

lutruwita’s THELIST has an opendata store with local topographic spatial
data. These are all listed in a [set of zip
files](https://listdata.thelist.tas.gov.au/opendata/data).

This project scans the contents of every zip, and produces

- a list of all the zips
- a list of the unique set of discovered file extensions
- a table of all the underlying files
- a cleaned up table of all the target files with a given file
  extension, and all the expanded GDB directories filtered out

WIP, after a bit more checking we’ll have links to these lists and some
code.
